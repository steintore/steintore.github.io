        <p>This blog is for me to try to help you, and to help myself remembering things and getting things done.
One of the most annoying things is to do the same thing over and over again, often somebody else has 
already done the same thing, or you could automate it.

At daytime I work at <a href="http://kodemaker.no">Kodemaker</a>, a great company, with great colleagues.
You can find all possible info about me <a href="http://kodemaker.no/stein-tore">there</a>, but only in Norwegian.

After work I'm the happy father of three kids, and I use most of my time with them, until they or me fall asleep.

After moving out of Oslo and into a big house, I started turning it into a smart home, but it takes time.
Many of the blog posts here will probably be about things I've done and tried, hope it is inspiring for you.
