<p>Jenkins has a lot of great plugins, but I think it lacks a really good plugin for a dashboard/wallboard on a TV. I've tried some of them, but none gives me and the team the information we need.</p>
<p>Some time back, much time was used to find out if our development environments where up and running or not. One of my colleagues even made a cup with the text "Is dev down?".</p>
<p>If found out it was time to do something, then another of my co-workers found <a href="http://shopify.github.io/dashing/" target="_blank">Dashing</a> a really nice dashboarding framework based on Ruby, Sinatra and CoffeeScript.</p>
<p>So, what do we need to know to be happy?</p>
<p>Well I found out that we need to know if Jenkins is currently building or deploying any of our apps. As we have "one-commit-deploy" to some of our environments it might build any time.</p>
<p>What I did was to create the <a href="https://gist.github.com/steintore/5322589" target="_blank">Jenkins Build</a> widget for Dashing. and now I'll explain what it can be used for.</p>
<p><strong>How did the last build/deploy go?</strong></p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_38" align="aligncenter" width="203"]<img class="wp-image-38 " alt="Build completed" src="assets/skjermbilde-2013-04-05-kl-23-03-25.png?w=254" width="203" height="240" /> Build completed[/caption]</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_35" align="aligncenter" width="200"]<img class="wp-image-35 " alt="Failed build" src="assets/skjermbilde-2013-04-05-kl-23-05-20.png?w=250" width="200" height="240" /> Failed build[/caption]</p>
<h2></h2>
<p>The two images shows us how the last build ended, the green one went OK, but the red one failed.</p>
<p><strong>Is something building right now?</strong></p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_36" align="aligncenter" width="200"]<img class="wp-image-36 " alt="Build in progress" src="assets/skjermbilde-2013-04-05-kl-23-04-17.png?w=250" width="200" height="240" /> Build in progress[/caption]</p>
<p>When a build/deploy is in progress, the widget turns grey, and the meter will move towards 100% done. The progress percentage will never be 100% accurate, since it checks how long the last build took and assumes this build will take the same amount of time, but this happens very seldom.</p>
<p>If the build takes longer than the last build, it will never go to more than 99%. When it finished, it either goes to a nice green widget or a red, failing one.</p>
<p><strong>Will a deploy/build soon begin?</strong></p>
<p>In my project we use Jenkins for deployment to two of our dev-environments, meaning when someone pushes to the git repo, Jenkins will see the changes and start a maven build (with deployment to Nexus) When the deployment is finished it will start another Jenkins-job to deploy the code. Based on this we want to know if a deployment will happen in the near future, this is shown as a build in progress, but with a yellowish background, as shown in the image.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_37" align="aligncenter" width="205"]<img class="wp-image-37 " alt="Prebuild in progress" src="assets/skjermbilde-2013-04-05-kl-23-03-47.png?w=256" width="205" height="240" /> Prebuild in progress[/caption]</p>
