<p>I've just recently written a post about a Dashing widget I've created, to shoud the status of a Jenkins build on i.e a big screen. You can read about it <a title="Jenkins build status widget forÂ Dashing" href="http://steintoretosse.wordpress.com/2013/04/05/jenkins-build-status-widget-for-dashing/">here</a>.</p>
<p>But it's not enough to have the build/deploy status on a big screen, we need some more information to tell us wether everything is okay, if our apps are running.</p>
<p>Based on experience and the questions other teammates asked me and other on the team, I've set up a Dashing dashboard that works quite nice for us.</p>
<p>!!! INSERT PICTURE HERE !!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The picture shows us one important thing: Are things running?</p>
<p>We can easily see if anything is deploying, or if it will be deployed soon.</p>
<p>Or if any of the smoketests has failed..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- why using a dashboard?</p>
<p>- Where it was found, dashing</p>
<p>- How it works,</p>
<p>- Changes</p>
<p>- gist for the jenkins-build</p>
