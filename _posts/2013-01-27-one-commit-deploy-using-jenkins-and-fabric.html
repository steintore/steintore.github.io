<p>By working as a test-developer at a big customer I have realized that the phrase "fail fast" is often underrated, the later we find errors or other problems stopping us deploying code to product the more expensive the cost of fixing it will be.<br />
After working a couple of months with optimizing deployment to all test-environments we have almost reached the goal of deploying "all the time" to avoid finding errors to late.</p>
<p><strong>Technologies</strong><br />
The choice of technologies where almost ready before we started thinking about optimizing deploys, the only choice we really had make was the use of Fabric for deployment of apps and settings. So the stack used for deployment is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fabric - for scripting</li>
<li>Jenkins - with a lot of plugins (explained later)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Jenkins</strong></p>
