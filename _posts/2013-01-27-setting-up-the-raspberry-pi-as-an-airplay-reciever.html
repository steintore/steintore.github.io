<p>After recieving my Raspberry Pi I was very eager to get it up and running, I searched the internet for good guides for setting it up as an Airplay device, but I couldn´t find one guide that gave me all the information I needed, so I´ll write down what I´ve done to get it up and running with WIFI, USB-speakers and USB-sound card all being powered from a single USB-hub.</p>
<p>The equipment I´ve used for this is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Raspberry Pi</li>
<li>USB Hub from Clas Ohlson</li>
<li>USB Wifi dongle from Clas Ohlson</li>
<li>USB sound card from deal extreme</li>
<li>USB speakers from NetonNet</li>
</ul>
<p><strong></strong></p>
