<p>To start using an advanced editors often seems like hell, that's why I've tried to make a short list of the commands I've used most.</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height:14px;">:sp &lt;filepath&gt; - split the screen and show multiple files. Move between the file with &lt;Ctrl-W&gt; and then the arrow keys</span></li>
<li>:%s/a/b/gc - substitute a with b globally with confirmation for each replacement</li>
</ul>
