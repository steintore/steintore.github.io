<p>As I've been searching the internet to find good methods of getting notifications to my phone about when something happens in my house, i stumbled across <a href="http://www.prowlapp.com/" target="_blank">Prowl</a>. It is free and easy to configure with openHAB, there's just one extra thing you'll have to remember.</p>

<p>To set up openHAB on your Raspberry Pi, check out <a title="Installing Raspbian and openHAB on my Raspberry Pi" href="http://steintoretosse.wordpress.com/2014/02/04/installing-raspbian-and-openhab-on-my-raspberry-pi/">this</a> post.</p>
<p>So let's configure it. First open up openhab/configurations/openhab.cfg in your choosen text editor. Then paste in the following text:</p>
<p>
  {% highlight bash %}
########################## Prowl Action configuration #################################
#
# the apikey for authentication (generated on the Prowl website)
prowl:apikey=insert-prowl-api-key-here
# the url of the Prowl public api
prowl:url=https://api.prowlapp.com/publicapi/
  {% endhighlight %}</p>
<p>Swap the text "insert-prowl-api-key-here" with your api-key found at the Prowl website: <a href="https://www.prowlapp.com/api_settings.php">https://www.prowlapp.com/api_settings.php</a></p>
<p>Also, check that the 'prowl:url' is correct.</p>
<p>Now you can make rules that sends you notifications to Prowl, like this:</p>
<p>
  {% highlight java %}
rule "Heat the livingroom"
  when
   Time cron "0 30 5 * * ?"
   then
     sendCommand(heating1, ON)
     sendCommand(heating2, ON)
     pushNotification("Heating","Heating of the livingroom has started")
  end
{% endhighlight %}</p>
